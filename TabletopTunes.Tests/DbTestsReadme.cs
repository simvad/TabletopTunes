 * NOTE: The database-related tests have been moved to this file 
 * as they require more setup to work with in-memory testing.
 * 
 * These tests need to be properly implemented with:
 * 
 * 1. A proper TestMusicPlayerDbContext that can work with EF Core's in-memory provider
 * 2. Proper isolation between tests
 * 3. Mocking of File I/O operations
 * 
 * The TrackQueryParserTests are working and provide good coverage of the 
 * query parsing functionality.
